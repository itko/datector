# Datector
Converting dates on websites to clickable "Add to Calendar" links.

## Status
Currently, Datector is a Google Chrome extension that inspects (almost) every website visited by the user. If a date is found, it is converted to an "Add to Google Calendar" link that automatically fills the date and time (according to the available information)

## Roadmap
- Automatically fill not just the date and time but also the title and description of the event. There are one or two extensions that do the former (including the Google Calendar extension) but none that do the latter. This might be a good use of machine learning.
- Move away from Google Calendar.Include other calendars and, eventually, create our own web-based calendar app.
- There's a slew of small aesthetic errors caused by the extension that should be fixed. As far as we can tell, this doesn't affect the functionality of any website.
